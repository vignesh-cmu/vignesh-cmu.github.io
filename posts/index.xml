      <description>Extend Cilk Scheduler with Suspend-Resume Concurrency Proposal Summary We are aiming to extend a research Cilk runtime library with concurrency support. Currently, Cilk only supports parallelism, as every worker have sole ownership on the task assigned through work-stealing during its lifetime, i.e. a running job will always be handled by 1 worker. We aim to extend Cilk semantics by giving tasks the ability to suspend, thereby unbinding from its current worker so the worker can execute other tasks; on the other hand, the suspended task should be able to resume execution once picked up by other workers.</description>
